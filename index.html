                I'm not one who likes to go on about myself however, since I don't have enough wealth to hire someone to write a bio for me, so I'll have to do it on my own.  Also, that would probably be cheating even though it isn't code.   Born in Norwalk, CT on April 30th, 1987, I was described as a very calm and gentle baby and later grew into an active and talkative toddler.  By the time I entered kindergarten at All Saints Catholic School I decided to go back to being a quiet child as discussing apple sauce and my favorite television show wasn't always interesting to everyone.

                During my high school and college years, growing up I had a love of computers and I recall spending hours and hours trying to understand HTML so that I may have the most amazing AOL and MySpace profiles and be the envy of my friends.  I expected that I would have entered this field as an adult, but life had other plans and I opted on obtaining a degree in Economics from the University of Conecticut.   However, my dream of creating code persisted and here I am in this coding bootcamp looking to make a change.  My goal is to obtain necessary skills to switch into a techonoly role in my current department.
